# Scale Finder

A simple yet modern music scale detector tool made with React.

## Introduction

Hi! I'm Ebbe, a software engineering student from Sweden who also dabbles in music production. I made this web app as a showcase project for my resum√©, but also because I wasn't satisfied with the online tools that already existed in its place. I hope this simple Scale Finder brings you joy. If it brings you misery, feel free to suggest improvements :-) More on that later.

## Features

- **Modern Interface**: Built with React, Scale Finder offers a sleek and user-friendly interface.
- **Accurate Detection**: Uses some pretty nifty algorithms to accurately detect music scales.
- **Responsive Design**: Works well on desktop, tablet and mobile devices.
